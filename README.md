# Alabama 2020 Markov Chain Simulation

## Overview

This project was developed as part of our **MATH 195 Final Project** at Claremont McKenna College under the guidance of Professor Sarah Cannon.  
We applied **Flip** and **ReCom Markov Chain algorithms** to analyze Alabama's 2020 Presidential Election data.  
The project aims to compare the outcomes of these algorithms and provide insights into the **partisan fairness** of the state.

### Installation

To set up your development environment and run the Python notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EthanTu2/alabama-2020-markov-sim
   cd alabama-2020-markov-sim
   ```

2. **Set up your Python environment:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts. Create and activate one as follows:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3.	**Install the required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install networkx matplotlib numpy pandas gerrychain geopandas maup tqdm fiona shapely pyproj
   ```

4.	**Deactivate the virtual environment (once finished):**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

You are now ready to run the Python notebooks!
