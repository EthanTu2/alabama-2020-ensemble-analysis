# Alabama 2020 Markov Chain Simulation

## Overview

This project was created for our MATH 195 Final Project at Claremont McKenna College instructed by Professor Sarah Cannon. 
We perform a Flip and ReCom Markov Chain on Alabama's 2020 Presidential Election Data to compare their results and offer insight into the partisan fairness of the state.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

Before proceeding, check that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or later 

# Installation

To get started with running the code, follow these steps to set up your
development environment and run the Python Notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/EthanTu2/alabama-2020-markov-sim
```

2. **Set up your Python environment:**
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts. Create and activate one as follows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the necessary Python packages:**

```
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy pandas gerrychain geopandas maup tqdm fiona shapely pyproj
```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment once finished**

```bash
deactivate
```

You are now ready to run the Python Notebooks!
